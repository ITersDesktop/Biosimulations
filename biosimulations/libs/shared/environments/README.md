# shared-environments

Contains environment files so that other libraries can have compile time information regarding the deployment environment.
This allows for compile time decisions such as importing modules based on environment that cannot be made at run-time
See [this post](https://indepth.dev/tiny-angular-application-projects-in-nx-workspaces/#add-compile-time-configuration-to-a-library) for example use case and setup
