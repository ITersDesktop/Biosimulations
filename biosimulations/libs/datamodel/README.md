# datamodel

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

The library contains the interfaces and models that are shared between the front end and backend services. This is currently a work in progress and breaking changes will be frequent.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test datamodel` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
